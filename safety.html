            <h2>Safety Factors</h2>
                <h3>Spacecraft Safety</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Orion (capable of carrying 1-3 travelers with a chaperone, and 2-4 without): This ship, newly designed by Lockheed Martin, is easily the most luxurious spacecraft to date. With a much larger interior than past models, new food storage systems for longer trips, and the smoothest landing, this ship is the best and brightest in spaceship technology. New safety features include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Launch Abort System: This system is a precaution used when the need to abort a launch becomes apparent after all astronauts have boarded the ship. If this needs to be triggered, and the trip can’t be rescheduled, all involved parties will be issued a full refund.
                        </li>
                        <li>Shock Absorption Technology: One of Lockheed Martin’s main goals for the Orion is to increase the safety of the launch and landing process for astronauts with new shock absorption technology.
                        </li>
                        <li>Temporary Radiation Shelter: Outside of standard radiation protection measures, in the event of a more significant solar flare, astronauts aboard the Orion will be able to assemble a temporary additional radiation shelter using onboard materials.
                        </li>
                        <p>Download a full explanation of all safety measures aboard the Orion <a href="pdfs/OrionSafetyMeasures.pdf">here!</a></p>
                    </ul>
                <h3>More Safety Checks and Regulations</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>State of the art vehicles</h4>
                            <p>Our company, by using the Orion spacecraft, will provide a fully safe and habitable environment for all astronauts. Not only does it contain new life support and environmental control systems, but also new fail-safe spacesuits in the event of a catastrophic systems failure that will allow for safe return. To read more about the Orion, download the PDF here                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>All astronauts will be able to fly and control the spaceship to some extent.
                            </h4>
                            <p>By requiring all astronauts to receive some level of certification before true space flight, as well as other requirements, such as the astronaut physical, this makes sure that the flight can be completed safely even in the event of our onboard chaperone becoming incapacitated for any reason. Additionally, if astronauts want to fly without a company chaperone, they will undergo far more intensive training in order to ensure all participants safety.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Spacesuit Training:</h4>
                            <p>Before takeoff, all members of the crew will be instructed on how to operate and use all spacesuits aboard the ship, including the takeoff/landing suit, and the standard space walk suit.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Ground Control:</li>
                        <p>With any mission launched, either chaperoned or alone, there will be 24/7 ground control available to communicate with in the event of an emergency. They will also be there to assist with the “mission control” aspects of takeoff and landing that cannot be completed aboard the ship.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Chaperones (as needed)</h4>
                        <p>In the event of a crew being more nervous about the flight and daily operations of a spaceship (most often for their first trip) than normal, and don’t want to fly alone, we have a trained group of astronauts who will be able to fly with groups of 3 or less and assist with the flight.
                        </p>

            <h2>Takeoff Procedure</h2>
            <p>The spacecraft begins in a vertical position on one of our launchpads, where it can be boarded. Following boarding, ignition begins, and the craft begins to takeoff. 66 seconds after takeoff, the first set of “strap on rockets” are discarded into the ocean, and the second set is activated. After another 66 seconds, this set is jettisoned too, leading to the final portions of takeoff, and the separation of the first and second stages. The second stage will then continue to propel the spacecraft until it runs out of fuel, where the third and final stage takes over, until the ship reaches cruising position. Detailed takeoff procedures and walkthroughs will be gone over and reviewed at either our test flight or pilot in command certifications.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Landing Procedure</h2>
            <p>We are able to provide you with 1 main landing site, and an alternate, and then safe transportation back to your launch site. We will be primarily using the landing site closest to your launch location. Landing is a multi-stage process, beginning with configuration of the ships onboard devices with around 4 hours to touchdown…. (read more..) Following that, all bay doors are closed aboard the craft, and our mission control team gives the “ok” to begin landing. Next, orange landing suits are donned by the crew and strap into their chairs, awaiting mission commands approval to begin the “deorbit burn.” After that, the spacecraft begins landing. Upon touchdown, the drag chute is deployed, and the craft eventually comes to a stop. In the event of an emergency, the launch abort system’s jettison motor will activate, and the craft will touch down for a water landing. If a water landing needs to be conducted, we will conduct crew retrieval immediately.

            <h2>Meet the Crew</h2>
            <p>
                There are 2 aspects to our lovely crew that helps you achieve your dream of going to space!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first is our experienced flight crew. Each is a previously certified astronaut, and is capable of acting as a chaperone for you during your first flight if you do not feel comfortable traveling by yourself, or solely with your friends. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On the other side, we have our “mission control” staff. These people, accustomed to working long hours, work rotating 12 hour shifts for the duration of space flights. They are there to help make sure you have the 24/7 land support you need in space, as well as making sure that the duration of the trip, from takeoff to landing, goes smoothly.
            </p>
