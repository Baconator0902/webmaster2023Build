        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>As the first true space tourism and public astronaut training company on the planet, To The Stars, is committed to providing all customers with the best possible space adventure for them. We believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to make it to space, Earth’s final frontier. We offer training plans and opportunities for any travelers who need a certification to meet our travel requirements, as well as vacation style trips for any group which meets the requirements. We also allow people to book solely training plans, if they only want to complete astronaut training, rather than taking a full trip to outer space at the moment.

                    <h4 style="list-style-image: url(images/flags/usa.png); padding-inline-start: 1ch;">USA</h4>
                    <p>This is our biggest hub, and the launch site of most of our space tours. This is also the largest astronaut training facility under our control, and, with its location in Texas, a brilliant launch location. Another thing to note is that most of our crew here speaks both Spanish and English for better accessibility.
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="list-style-image: url(images/flags/canada.png); padding-inline-start: 1ch;">Canada</h4>
                    <p>Through recent partnerships with the Canadian Space Agency, we are proud to present our newest location, The Canadian Launch outside of Quebec. This facility boasts similar levels of the one in Texas, though is not quite as large. Please note that most of our crew here speaks both French and English.

                    <p>This location outside of London serves as our European Hub, and acts as an accessibility hub for some people who do not speak French or Spanish. We have at least one employee here capable of speaking French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Russian, and Italian.

                    <p> Our goal in the next ten years is to open up a launch hub in both South America (with the planned location in Argentina) and Australia (in Sydney). We are also working towards an agreement with the Russian government that would allow us to open a launch location just outside of Moscow.

        <h2>Past Trips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Quick Out and Back (departure and return in England): This 4 day trip was custom planned by a group of three out of France who elected to travel with our chaperone! 
                </li>
                <li>The ISS Express (departure and return from Canada): This trip, highlighted on the landing page, is a classic. This was successfully completed by a group of 2 returning astronauts alone, and was their third trip with the company.
                </li>
                <li>The Orbiter (departure and return from USA): This trip is the newest “template” trip for our company, and features 6 days of low earth orbit travel. This “easy” trip is perfect for newer travelers, and was completed by an individual with 1 of our chaperones.

        <h2>Highlights</h2>
            <ul id="highlightsUl">
                <li>
                    <h4>Spacewalk</h4>
                    <p>This activity is perhaps the most famous astronaut activity of them all, and is featured on the majority of our trips. It involves wearing a spacesuit and venturing out of the ship while remaining attached via a return cord. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Tour of the ISS</h4>
                    <p>This activity is one of the more uncommon ones, unless expressly included in the trip planning or pricing (namely on trips like the ISS express) and is perhaps the most interesting of the space activities. Participants get the opportunity to experience life aboard the ISS, and meet other astronauts and see their onboard research, barring classification.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The View</h4>
                    <p>Potentially the most incredible part of any of these trips is just the ability to see Earth from outer space, take some amazing pictures and make some amazing memories. While it obviously can’t be instagrammed in space, it sure can be upon return!
